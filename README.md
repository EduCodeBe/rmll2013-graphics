Resources
---------
  resources/

If you add any resource found on the net:

* Make sure it's free for usage & modifications, e.g. CC-BY, *-SA (__not__ *-ND or *-NC), FDL, PD

* Make sure to track from where it comes and what will be the attribution text to add somewhere if we use that image.
  For that, create a text file with the same name as the resource.

* Be careful that even if the photograph allows free use, some subjects are not free for use anyway!

  * If people are represented (not in a crowd) they must provide their agreement too

  * Some monuments are not free at all:

    * Atomium: http://atomium.be/authorsrights.aspx & https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Atomium_related_deletion_requests
