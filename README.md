Resources

  resources/

If you add any resource found on the net:

* Make sure it's free for usage & modifications (e.g. CC-BY, *-SA, *-NC, __not__ *-ND)

* Make sure to track from where it comes and what will be the attribution text to add somewhere if we use that image.
  For that, create a text file with the same name as the resource.
